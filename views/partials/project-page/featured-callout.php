        The goal of the project is to promote and strengthen measures to prevent and fight
        corruption more efficiently and effectively in the Pacific. This aligns with the purpose
        of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and contributes to the
        achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 on Peace, Justice and Strong
        Institutions.
        </br></br>
        At the end of the project, we expect to achieve the following results:</br></br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                PICs more effectively implement UNCAC and work towards the achievement of SDG
                16.
            </li>
            <li>
                PICs strengthen broader governance frameworks in line with UNCAC and SDG 16.
            </li>
            <li>
                PICsâ€™ state and non-state actors more effectively engage and partner to prevent
                and fight corruption.
            </li>
