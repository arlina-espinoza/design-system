                        The number of undernourished people has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because
                        of rapid economic growth and increased agricultural productivity. Many developing countries that
                        used to suffer from famine and hunger can now meet their nutritional needs. Central and East
                        Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all made huge progress in eradicating extreme hunger.

                        Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many
                        countries. There are 821 million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017,
                        often as a direct consequence of environmental degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over
                        90 million children under five are dangerously underweight. Undernourishment and severe food
                        insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of Africa, as well as in South America.

                        The SDGs aim to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, making sure all
                        people–especially children–have sufficient and nutritious food all year. This involves promoting
                        sustainable agricultural, supporting small-scale farmers and equal access to land, technology
                        and markets. It also requires international cooperation to ensure investment in infrastructure
                        and technology to improve agricultural productivity.
