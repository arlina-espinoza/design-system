                    The United Nations Pacific Regional Anti-Corruption Project is a joint initiative of the United Nations
                    Office on Drugs and Crime and the United Nations Development Programme, a unique partnership to prevent
                    and fight corruption in 14 Pacific Island countries and the territory of Tokelau.</br></br>
                    UN-PRAC aims to strengthen PICs’ national integrity systems. This is to promote ‘clean’
                    governments and create an enabling environment to increase trade, business, investment and
                    sustainable development in the Pacific. In turn, this will enhance the delivery of equitable and
                    high-quality services to all Pacific Islanders.
