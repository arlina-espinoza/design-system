                    The goal of the project is to promote and strengthen measures to prevent and fight
                    corruption more efficiently and effectively in the Pacific. This aligns with the purpose
                    of the <a href="#" class="animated-underline">United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)</a>
                    and contributes to the achievement of <a href="#" class="animated-underline">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16 on Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.</a>
